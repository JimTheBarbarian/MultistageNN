# Multi-stage training scheme for neural networks

Codes associated with the manuscript titled "Multi-stage neural networks: Function approximator of machine precision" authored by Yongji wang and Ching-Yao Lai. We provide two examples, one for multi-stage training for regression problem and the other for the physics-informed neural networks.
